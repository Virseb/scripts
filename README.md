# Skybox loader scripts for exploits

** Script made in luau **

use this in your script

``` lua
local skyboxmaker = loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Virseb/scripts/main/skyBL.lua"))()

script:printnames() -- it prints the names of the choices you have

YourScriptName:skyboxcreator(choice) -- replace choice with ex: Waves

```
# you cannot require it 
so just copy the script from
 https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Virseb/scripts/main/skyBL.lua

 


dont steal this script cause it isnt too hard to recreate and atleast
you can get it but dont take credit
